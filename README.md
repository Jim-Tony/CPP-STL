<h2>Important STL containers with some examples.</h2>
Hey All, here I've placed the basic STL containers along with their basic operations.<br><br>
<i>The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.</i><br>
